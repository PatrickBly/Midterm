                <h1>General Tso's Chicken</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Normally, I don't like Chicken because it is tough and hard to chew if it's grilled, but the way general Tso's is made, it's easy to chew.</p>

                <h1>Sushi</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Sushi can contain many foods inside of it. This gives it potential to be both very good and very bad. The majority of the time you get to choose whats in it so you end up with a good sushi roll.</p>

                <h1>Fried Cod</h1>
            </header>
            <p>As opposed to grilled meats like chicken and steak, fish is easier to chew and when paired with Tartar sauce, tastes better.</p>

                <h1>Orange Chicken</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Orange Chicken is just like General Tso's but it has a sweeter sauce. The sauce tastes good but I would not rate it as high as General Tso's.</p>

                <h1>Naan Pizza</h1>
            </header>
            <p>The Pizza is easy to make and overflows with grease. It's not healthy in any way but tastes very good.</p>
